Profile README - About LeFinneus

Hi there! My name is Sheila, but I go by LeFinneus online.

Currently, I am an online-only student at Liberty University (Lynchburg, VA) - a double major (Graphic Design and Bible) with dual minors (History and Biblical Studies). I am set to graduate with my BFA in Graphic Design and my minors completed in May 2025.

I have three associate degrees - Graphic Arts Technology (Print Prepress/Production), Graphic Design, and Web Development/Media Design. I keep adding to my education because technology and techniques keep changing and I have a life goal of being the first person in my family to graduate a four-year university with a degree.

My interests? I've been accused of being eclectic, as I am all over the place with interests. I love creating, watching documentaries, repairing computers, collecting vintage automobiles (I have three 1965 Ford Mustangsâ€”2 coupes and 1 GT convertible), researching, repairing vehicles, traveling, cooking, and just chillin' at home with my favorite radio station playing.

As for music, I enjoy a wide variety - from 1940s swing, the Rat Pack standards, 60s-90's pop/rock, classic country (50s-90s), hairbands (Guns n Roses, Poison, Def Lepard), hard rock/metal (Metallica, Volbeat), some rap/hip hop (Snoop, NWA, Eminem, Ludacris, Tupac, Outkast), Indie rock (Him and She, Jennifer Kendrick, Pomplamoose), and alternative/grunge (90s - Green Day, Weezer, Gin Blossoms, Soul Asylum, Nirvana).
